# The code you've provided is written in Ruby and defines a function pickingNumbers that aims to find the length of the maximum subarray (or subsequence) of an array a, where the absolute difference between any two elements in the subarray is at most 1. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:
# max_length = 0: Initialize a variable max_length to keep track of the maximum subarray length found. Start with a value of 0.
# a.each do |num|: Start iterating through the elements of the input array a using Ruby's each method.
# Inside the loop, for each element num in the array:
# count_num = a.count(num): Count the occurrences of the current element num in the entire array a. This variable count_num represents the number of times the current element appears in the array.
# count_num_plus_one = a.count(num + 1): Similarly, count the occurrences of the element that is one greater than the current element (num + 1).
# current_length = count_num + count_num_plus_one: Calculate the length of the subarray that includes the current element num and the element one greater (num + 1). This length represents the number of elements in the subarray where the absolute difference between any two elements is at most 1.
# max_length = [max_length, current_length].max: Update the max_length variable with the maximum value between the current max_length and the current_length calculated for the current element. This ensures that max_length always holds the length of the longest subarray found so far.
# Repeat steps 3-5 for each unique element in the array.
# return max_length: After iterating through all the unique elements and calculating the maximum subarray length, return the max_length as the result.
# This code efficiently finds the maximum subarray length that meets the specified criteria without needing to sort the input array. It counts the occurrences of elements and their adjacent elements and keeps track of the maximum length found during the iteration.
